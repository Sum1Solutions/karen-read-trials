# Karen Read Trial Evidence Tracker

This project is a public, open-source initiative to document and compare the evidence and arguments presented to the jury in both the first Karen Read trial (2024) and the retrial (2025). The goal is to provide a clear, referenced, and accessible summary of what the jury saw, heard, and was asked to decide—empowering the public, press, and researchers to follow the case with transparency and context.

## Project Purpose

- **Transparency:** Present the facts, exhibits, and legal arguments as they were known to the jury, with references to original sources and media coverage.
- **Comparison:** Allow side-by-side review of prosecution and defense narratives across both trials, highlighting how the evidence and arguments evolved.
- **Accessibility:** Make complex trial information readable and navigable for all audiences, including those on mobile devices.
- **Public Interest:** Support informed discussion and reporting by providing a single, well-organized resource with links to all major news and official sources.

## How It Works

- The main landing page features the most current, LLM-synthesized jury-known facts table (with references), plus links to the original evidence table and a comprehensive list of sources.
- All tables are fully referenced, with direct links to official trial coverage, news galleries, and key documents.
- The site is non-partisan and does not advocate for any party or outcome.

## Ultimate Goal: Bayesian Analysis & Prediction

A long-term objective for this project is to incorporate a Bayesian analysis framework, enabling the site to serve as a foundation for probabilistic modeling and prediction of jury decisions. By assigning likelihoods to various facts, arguments, and evidence, and updating these as new information emerges, we aim to build an interactive tool that can:

- Model how jurors might weigh competing narratives and evidence
- Allow users to explore how changes in evidence or argument strength could shift predicted outcomes
- Provide a transparent, data-driven approach to understanding legal decision-making in complex trials

This feature would make the project not only a reference for what happened in the Karen Read trials, but also a living demonstration of how Bayesian reasoning can be applied to real-world legal cases.

## Collaboration

This is a collaborative, open-source project. Contributions are welcome—whether you have updated information, corrections, official exhibit lists, or suggestions for improvement. Please open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
