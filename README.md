# Karen Read Trial Evidence Tracker

This project is a comprehensive, open-source initiative to document and compare the evidence and arguments presented to the jury in both the first Karen Read trial (2024) and the retrial (2025). Updated through June 16, 2025, this project synthesizes all facts known to the jury in both trials.

## Project Status (June 2025 - Updated)

**Current Trial Status:** Jury deliberations began on June 13, 2025, after 31 total trial days. The defense presented their case over 7 days, followed by closing arguments from both sides.

**Key Developments:**
- Defense presented crash reconstruction and forensic evidence challenging the prosecution's narrative
- Both sides delivered closing arguments on June 12, 2025
- Jury is currently deliberating on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene

**Site Features:**
- **Evidence Comparison Table:** 19 key facts comparing prosecution vs defense arguments across both trials
- **Daily Trial Timeline:** Comprehensive day-by-day breakdown of all 31 trial days (April 22 - June 13, 2025)
- **Updated References:** 30+ verified sources from major news outlets and court coverage

## What We Built

### 1. **Comprehensive Evidence Analysis**
- **Main Evidence Table:** Side-by-side comparison of how each key fact was presented by prosecution and defense in both the 2024 trial and 2025 retrial
- **15 Key Evidence Items:** From the discovery of John O'Keefe's body to the latest expert testimony
- **Cross-Referenced:** Each evidence item linked to original sources and news coverage

### 2. **Daily Trial Timeline (New Feature)**
- **Complete Day-by-Day Coverage:** Every trial day from opening statements to prosecution rest
- **Witness Details:** Who testified, what they said, and key points from each day
- **Prosecution vs Defense:** Daily breakdown of competing arguments and strategies
- **Evidence Correlation:** Each day linked to relevant facts in the main evidence table

### 3. **Enhanced Source Documentation**
- **25+ References:** Verified links to Court TV, CNN, Boston Globe, WCVB, Fox News, and other major outlets
- **Retrial-Specific Coverage:** Sources covering unique developments in the 2025 retrial
- **Timeline Tracking:** Key dates, witness counts, and trial phases documented

## How We Built It

### **Research & Data Collection**
- **Web Search & Analysis:** Comprehensive search of major news outlets for daily trial coverage
- **Source Verification:** Cross-referenced multiple sources for accuracy
- **Real-Time Updates:** Information current through prosecution case completion (May 30, 2025)

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Static HTML Site:** Clean, fast-loading pages optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Responsive Tables:** Custom CSS for readable tables across all device sizes
- **Cross-Linking:** Internal navigation between evidence table and daily timeline
- **Accessibility:** Proper semantic HTML and mobile-responsive design
- **AI-Assisted Analysis:** This project utilizes AI language models (Claude and ChatGPT) to help synthesize and organize complex trial information while maintaining strict adherence to factual reporting

### **Content Organization**
- **Evidence Synthesis:** Combined information from 38 witnesses and 23 days of testimony
- **Fact Correlation:** Each daily timeline entry references specific evidence table items
- **Balanced Presentation:** Equal space given to prosecution and defense arguments

## Project Purpose

- **Transparency:** Present the facts, exhibits, and legal arguments as they were known to the jury, with references to original sources and media coverage.
- **Comparison:** Allow side-by-side review of prosecution and defense narratives across both trials, highlighting how the evidence and arguments evolved.
- **Accessibility:** Make complex trial information readable and navigable for all audiences, including those on mobile devices.
- **Public Interest:** Support informed discussion and reporting by providing a single, well-organized resource with links to all major news and official sources.

## Key Retrial Developments Documented

### **Major Changes from First Trial:**
- **Michael Proctor Absent:** Lead investigator fired between trials for misconduct
- **Enhanced Expert Testimony:** New crash reconstruction and digital forensics analysis
- **Expanded Defense Case:** "More robust" defense strategy with additional witnesses
- **New Evidence:** Rice-sized plastic debris, SUV scuff mark analysis, timeline discrepancies

### **Trial Timeline Captured:**
- **Jury Selection:** April 1-15, 2025 (18 jurors selected)
- **Prosecution Case:** April 22 - May 30, 2025 (38 witnesses, 23 days)
- **Defense Case:** Began May 30, 2025 with crash expert DiSogra
- **Key Witnesses:** Jennifer McCabe (3 days), Dr. Judson Welcher, Shanon Burgess

## Future Goals

### **Ongoing Updates**
- Defense case completion and verdict coverage
- Additional expert witness testimony analysis
- Final jury deliberation and outcome documentation

### **Long-term Vision: Bayesian Analysis**
A future objective is to incorporate a Bayesian analysis framework, enabling the site to serve as a foundation for probabilistic modeling and prediction of jury decisions. This would allow users to:
- Model how jurors might weigh competing narratives and evidence
- Explore how changes in evidence strength could shift predicted outcomes
- Provide transparent, data-driven analysis of legal decision-making
